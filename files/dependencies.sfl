<title>Dependencies
<text>ArnavDB does not use any Dependancies, however it will require 
you to install the user side script for ease of access. Additionally you will need to 
download the [Wrangler API][code] for local access of the database.


If you don't want to install any dependancies you can just use the online interface.
